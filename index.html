          I am not exactly sure what to put here yet so I will just leave this
          as is. Maybe I should put a picture here, or some graphic of some
          sort. I don't know.

          I also think I should extend the padding and margin on these two
          columns so that they do not appear like a single item as they do right
          now. I will start workin on it as soon as I get done being lazy.
